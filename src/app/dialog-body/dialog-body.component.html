    <span>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span>
    <div>
    Users do not need to create accounts or provide their information just to read news. Hence, there is very little information that we absolutely need in order for our website to function. But, knowing the preferred categories of news for users would be helpful as we can provide them with more stories in these categories, all the different views people are sharing in these categories and so on. User contact information such as their email address would also be helpful to send them our newsletter. Additionally, this gives the user added capabilities such as to like, comment or share their views on the articles by our editors. Much like the offline equivalents, we would like to integrate ad services in our website to help us monetize our website.
